## Reminders

- [ ] Did you bump the version in `package.json` so that releases to npm are
      made without version conflict?
  - [ ] Did you also run `npm install` to update the version number in the `package.lock`?
- If you'd like to see this code deployed after merge, don't forget to cut a release in this repo, then update the package versions in [discovery-ui](https://github.com/UrbanOS-public/discovery_ui)
